#WebTerm v0.1
Mockup web terminal, built as practice in an afternoon while learning Javascript.

Might be extended in the future to serve as a command window for my web server at home. It might be useful to be able to access certain parts of the server from a web browser, given that I don't have access to a terminal or something similar. 

Time will tell.
